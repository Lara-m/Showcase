#README

This small projects aims to provide one PHP single page app in couple of hours by someone who hasn't programed php in years, with the aim to just show that literally anyone can program in php, even if they have migraine today, like I do, and even I can too. It doesn't have a db and the backend is not sophisticated. If you get any errors, confirmations will not show. 

Cheers! 

P.S. May your brain never feel hammered!
