#README


I meant to extend on the to do app that's available in EmberJS (V 1) website and use angular. I have used some publicly available open source to do apps I found on the Internet.

I knowingly refused to use extra directives and routing. Too many bugs and it seemed overkill for such a small project.

I also have not used cookies and other services to save the list.
